# Fibonacci-Nim
Interfaces the game Fibonacci Nim

Rules:
1. The game is for two players
2. Players take it in turns to play
• The players have three heaps of tokens
• They take it in turns to take tokens from ONE heap
• On the first round, they can only take 1 or 2 tokens from a heap
• After that, they may take up to twice as many as the maximum taken so far
• So if on the first round, player 1 took 1 token, player 2 can take up to 2 tokens
• But if on the first round player 1 took 2 tokens, player 2 can take up to 4 tokens
• They obviously cannot take more tokens than are present in a heap
